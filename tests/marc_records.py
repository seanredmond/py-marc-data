Within each filing series negatives and transparencies are arranged numerically by a one-up number assigned by the photographer. Photographic prints or digital scans serve as reference copies for the negatives and transparencies and are organized by project or subject into groups with the call number designation LOT.  Each LOT is cataloged separately and linked through the collection title: Carol M. Highsmith archive.0 aThe archive consists primarily of photographs documenting buildings, urban renewal efforts, and historic preservation. Many of the photographs document the Washington, D.C. area.  Projects for the General Services Administration (GSA) show US government buildings through the United States. Projects for the Urban Land Institute document urban settings such as San Antonio, Texas and the greater Los Angeles, California region. Also included are photographs of President Ronald Reagan meeting with Republican Senatorial candidates and photographs of Lexington, Virginia. In addition, there are two photographs taken near the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.0 aIn 2007, the photographer began to add born digital photographs to the archive, beginning with a large project documenting the Library of Congress buildings; continuing the GSA building documentation; and in 2009 launching the Carol M. Highsmith's America project to document each state in the United States, starting with Alabama.8 aPublished images must bear the credit line: The Library of Congress, Carol M. Highsmith Archive.  aNo known restrictions on publication. Photographs are in the public domain.  aDistinguished architectural photographer, based in Washington, D.C., Highsmith documents architecture and architectural renovation projects in the nation's capitol and throughout the United States.

The catalog record will be updated as new accessions are processed.  aCollection includes Highsmith's captions which accompany the images.  cGift;aCarol M.
